#### Install Git and create a repository

Installing Git prompts you to select a text editor. If you donâ€™t have one, we strongly advise you to install it before installing Git. Our roundup of the best text editors for coding may help you decide.

#### Creating branches with GitHub

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

#### Create and explore Pull request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. Pull Requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the Shared Repository Model, where everyone shares a single repository, and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. Many open source projects on GitHub use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.

#### Editing a file and committing changes on GitHub

Git commits are snapshots of a project's files at specific moments, each identified by a unique SHA-1 hash. They include metadata like author details, timestamps, and commit messages. Commits form a directed acyclic graph, with branches pointing to specific commits. Clear commit messages are crucial for documenting changes, and commits should represent atomic changes for clarity and ease of management. Git offers tools for manipulating commit history, but caution is necessary to maintain a coherent project history, especially in collaborative settings.
